# Lab 01 - Handler lab

By the end of this lab you will be a handler ninja!

Simply make all the feature methods in `HandlersSpec` pass by adding the right handlers to `Ratpack.groovy`.
Try to make each feature method pass in order and refactor as you go.

This lab covers:

* Simple routing
* Routing by HTTP method
* Routing by HTTP header
* Grouping handlers with the same prefix
* Routing by regular expression
* Using path tokens
